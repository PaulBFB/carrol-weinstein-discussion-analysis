Well, up until the 20th century, it's considered to be a matter of common sense. We lived in a material and objective reality, perhaps created by God, but one that could be accurately measured and predicted. And then came Einstein, who revolutionized everything by saying that things were a lot more relative than all that. Space could bend time. Mysterious black holes existed. The universe was expanding. But even Albert Einstein failed to truly grapple with what came next. The wild world of quantum physics, where nothing plays by the rules, even Einstein's, and things seem to exist in two places at once. Today, the biggest brains on the planet are loggerheads over what this all means and where science goes next. Are there multiple universes? Do we live in a matrix-style simulation? Could there be an intelligent designer? For the special uncensored debate, I'm joined by two scientists with very different answers to the very big question.

And in fact, very famous string theorist, Joe Polchinsky wrote a very influential paper called What is string theory? Decades after string theory started being a popular theory to think about. And the fact is we still don't know yet, it's an approach. You start with a very simple idea that instead of the universe being made of particle-like things at the fundamental level, like the electron being a point-like particle, the photon, etc., which we all knew wasn't exactly right anyway, but we can talk about that later, replaced that with a little loop of vibrating string. Now, why would you do that? There's a prehistory that goes into features of the strong interactions that motivated people to do it. They looked at this idea, what if the world were made of little loops of string rather than point particles? Problematically, the theory kept failing at what they were trying to do with it, which is explained the strong nuclear force because it kept predicting the existence of gravity. So eventually people said, well, wait a minute, gravity exists. Maybe this is a theory of gravity as well. And after many, many years of hard work on the part of people who were otherwise ignored by the community, they showed that it's actually a very successful theory of gravity and possibly everything else. You have to buy a lot of extra stuff like extra dimensions of space time that we don't see and so forth, what it's called the holographic principle, which again, we could get into if you want to. But the theory keeps moving forward while at the same time, utterly failing to connect directly with experiments. So this has caused, you know, a lot of hair pulling among the physics community. The theory looks very promising, but we haven't actually been able to put it to work to connect to the real world.","{'concept_name': 'Holographic Principle', 'explanation_of_concept': 'An idea in string theory suggesting that information contained in a region of space can be encoded on its surface, requiring extra dimensions beyond our observable universe.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}",,,,

Sean,825.73,1078.185,252.455,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m7LnLgvMnM&t=825," Apparently, yeah, I didn't know, but now, you know, the weight is bearing down on my shoulders. Look, the story Eric just told is a kind of wacky and wildly misleading history of physics in the last 50 or 60 years. The idea of quantum gravity is a very natural one because the world runs by the rules of quantum mechanics as far as we know. This is the international year of quantum because it's the 100th anniversary of really figuring out how quantum mechanics works. And the thing about quantum mechanics is it's not a theory by itself. It's a framework in which you can do theories in contrast with classical mechanics from Isaac Newton that came before it. And gravity, our best current theory of gravity from Einstein, the theory of general relativity, is a thoroughgoingly classical theory. Certainly the default expectation is that someday we will better understand gravity at the quantum level. You don't have to think that because you don't have to think anything. You're welcome to come up with better theories. But again, that's the default expectation. If you have a different point of view, there's a certain burden of proof to convince people that it's interesting to contemplate this other point of view. The idea of actually doing the detailed calculations to quantize gravity goes back to at least the 1950s, but it instantly hit roadblocks, and physicists were smart enough to know that it wasn't working the way they wanted it to. The very simple thing you do, if I can get just a little bit detailed for a second here, because people never hear this. And I think it's really, really important to understand why string theory is so popular. If you want to invent a new quantum mechanical theory of the world, the first thing you do is you ask yourself, if I have two particles and they come together and scatter, there's a probability that different things will happen. I'm going to make photons, I'm going to make electrons and positrons or whatever, and you calculate that probability. And the famous triumph of mid-20th century physics was to show that you can do that and get a finite answer. If you're sloppy about it, your answer turns out to be infinity and your theories on the wrong track. Everything that we know about in the physical world has a nice finite answer in this quantum mechanical realm except for gravity. Gravity doesn't fit. And indeed, it was recognized pretty quickly that there was a good reason why gravity doesn't fit, and it was almost impossible to imagine fitting gravity in, namely that gravity interacts with everything. Gravity interacts with photons, with electrons, with quarks, with whatever. And so when you do this scattering experiment, you do the calculation, everything in the universe contributes to the infinitely big answer that you don't want to get. Apparently, what you would need is some kind of miraculous cancellation between all the different contributions from all the different fields. And people looked at that and said, we have no idea how to make that happen. Let's not worry about quantum gravity. And then string theory comes along. And again, it wasn't even trying to be a theory of gravity. But when they do this calculation, the miraculous cancellation happens in string theory. You get a finite answer to what happens when you scatter different particles off of each other. That is right now the only theory in which that miraculous happening actually works. And this was finally put together as a sort of sensible, viable theory in the mid-1980s. And it was a calculation by John Schwartz and Michael Green that showed that the theory did not have what are called anomalies. And you can look up the magazines at the time. Physics today ran an article saying anomaly cancellation launches super string bandwagon. The point is, the reason why I had to go into those details is many, many physicists instantly became interested in string theory and quantum gravity who were not before. But the reason they did is not because Ed Witten is a smart guy and he towers over the field. It's because there was a calculation that showed the theory is promising. Physicists are not sheep. If Ed Witten had said, we should all work on this, but everyone else looked at it and thought it wasn't very promising, he would have been ignored. But since then, there's no competitor to string theory that has had that miraculous feature that string theory has.","{'concept_name': 'General Relativity', 'explanation_of_concept': ""Einstein's theory of gravity, a classical theory that describes the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy."", 'education_level': 'Undergraduate'}","{'concept_name': 'Quantum Gravity', 'explanation_of_concept': 'The attempt to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single theory that can describe gravity at the quantum level.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}","{'concept_name': 'String Theory', 'explanation_of_concept': 'A theoretical framework that attempts to unify the fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, by postulating that particles are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like objects.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}",,

I'm a believer in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. That's a question about the foundations of quantum mechanics, which again goes back to the 1950s. But that is more or less separate from the question of which model within the world of quantum mechanics is the right one. Is it field theory? Is it string theory? Is it loop quantum gravity? Is it something else? So I do believe that the best understanding of quantum mechanics we have right now implies the existence of parallel universes. Again, that could be true. And if we have a better theory that comes along, I'm happy to change my mind. There's also a separate idea of the multiverse that comes with combining string theory with inflationary cosmology, a scenario of what happened very close to the Big Bang. So those are two different ideas about the multiverse. Many worlds of quantum mechanics says literally every time I make a quantum measurement, now there's two worlds in which different measurement outcomes were obtained. The string theory multiverse says very, very, very far away in cosmological distance, there's a patch of space where conditions look remarkably different than they do here.","{'concept_name': 'Quantum Mechanics', 'explanation_of_concept': 'A branch of physics dealing with the behavior of matter and energy at an atomic and subatomic level.', 'education_level': 'High School'}","{'concept_name': 'String Theory', 'explanation_of_concept': 'A theoretical framework in physics attempting to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity by postulating that particles are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like objects.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}","{'concept_name': 'Inflationary Cosmology', 'explanation_of_concept': 'A theory of the early universe proposing a rapid expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang, smoothing out any irregularities and explaining the homogeneity of the universe.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}","{'concept_name': 'Loop Quantum Gravity', 'explanation_of_concept': 'A theoretical framework attempting to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity by describing spacetime as a network of discrete loops rather than a continuous fabric.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}",

You could also decide to geometrize the quantum rather than quantize gravity and thus quantize the geometry. So because Sean's framework precludes somebody saying something outside the framework, the inference is that someone ignorantly just said that gravity can be kept out of the quantum framework, which I absolutely don't say. You'll also notice that Sean did not choose to take issue with the fact that one of these is a gauge theory and another one isn't a gauge theory, and so that there is a problem with gauging gravity and what that means, and the fact that we're getting no actual progress in the harmonization of gravity with the quantum that can give us a green light and tell us where we're going. Like, I would happily see to Sean all sorts of things, like the string theorists are by far the smarter group of all people trying to go beyond the standard model in general relativity. I would further see that if the task is to quantize gravity directly, the string theorists and the string theory program have been more successful.

I don't think that's the standard to which we would like to aspire. There are professional physicists right there in your country who work on understanding quantum gravity, field theory, geometry at a deep level, and you could ask them what they think.

But I would like to let people out there know who might be working outside the academic physics community that it is 100% possible to have a good idea and have it have an impact on what physicists do. But it's not easy. You have to do a certain amount of work to show that your theory is worth the time, that it is respectable, that it is interesting, that it is promising. The first thing you got to do is make sure that your theory makes contact with modern physics as it is understood. If you have a new paper out, businesses are going to look at it, they're going to look for, you know, where's the Lagrangian? Where's the interactions? Is the proton stable? Is there dark matter? Like, how does it fit into what I already know?

Is it stable? Is it free of anomalies? Is it finite in the sense of the quantum mechanical calculation that I already mentioned? Again, none of that is there. Are there any new predictions? Eric says, and completely correctly, string theory doesn't make any new predictions either. But also, I really don't want people to get the idea that string theory has some dominant picture. In my department at Johns Hopkins, we have, let me just finish, and then you can talk. I think it's a good system. In my department at Johns Hopkins, we have six professors in the theoretical physics group. One of them does string theory, and even he only does it sort of half time. I wish we had more, honestly. This is very typical. Even at the most stringy departments, it's maybe half the people who do string theory. There are plenty of other approaches being advocated, and many of them do make different predictions, and we're looking for them in cosmology and astrophysics and elsewhere. And finally, does your theory solve any interesting problems that we already thought we had? That's the reason why string theory became interesting, because we had this problem with quantum gravity that it gave infinite answers, and string theory solved that problem. And again, I see none of that in Eric's paper. So it's very possible that somewhere in Eric's theory there are interesting ideas, but he has given us no reason to think that it is a promising theory.

So just as you can play a record, and when the stylus comes to the inner circles of the record, you can jump again to any track that you like on a cassette tape. You have to go back through time. So my belief is, no, we will not go back through time, but we will have to figure out how to stop thinking in terms of initial conditions, because it is only in the case of a single dimension of time leading to hyperbolic equations, that you have that luxury. So I think that times travel is going to be perhaps the most interesting thing to come out when you ask, why should we worry about these things? Buckle up.","{'concept_name': 'Hyperbolic Equations', 'explanation_of_concept': 'A type of equation used to describe the behavior of systems with multiple dimensions of time.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}","{'concept_name': 'Ultra-Hyperbolic Equations', 'explanation_of_concept': 'An extension of hyperbolic equations that allows for more complex and non-linear relationships between different dimensions of time.', 'education_level': 'Graduate'}",,,

That is a one comma three problem where you have one dimension of time, three of space, and you can prove that there's something called an essential singularity in the center of a black hole, a Schwarzenold singularity, and an initial singularity, and what would be called a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric.
