0:00,what is your main bone of contention with Eric Weinstein uh you should probably ask Eric that sean has been
0:06,nothing but civil he's also extremely nasty so let me say a bunch of things to Dr carol dr carol I'd like to hear your
0:15,explanation for three generations of flavored chyro firmians with the observed quantum numbers under the group
0:20,SU3 plus SU2 SU1 i have read Eric's paper here it is i actually have it here
0:26,it's worse than you would think how dare you how dare I read your paper i highly advise you to spend more time in your
0:32,physics department and less time on YouTube so we're not allowed to think about Eric's theory and write a
0:37,follow-up paper about it and although you're very much Sean I have my disagreements with string theorists my
0:44,agreements with them but I respect it and I think that they're trying their best the first rule of physics fight
0:50,club is don't talk about the problems with physics fight club i have found myself in the awkward and unenviable
0:56,position of defending the establishment heterodoxy your intellectually insulting
1:02,uh aspect reminds me of you as the Maran Twinette of theoretical physics influencer given I've only understood
1:09,about one tenth of what either of you has said for the last hour i would like to end on a point where none of us know
1:16,the answer to something for centuries scientists have grappled with the most fundamental
1:22,question of them all what is reality well up until the 20th century it was considered to be a matter of common
1:28,sense we lived in a material and objective reality perhaps created by God but one that could be accurately
1:33,measured and predicted and then came Einstein who revolutionized everything by saying that things were a lot more
1:39,relative than all that space could bend time mysterious black holes existed the
1:44,universe was expanding but even Albert Einstein failed to truly grapple with what came next the wild world of quantum
1:52,physics where nothing plays by the rules even Einstein's and things seem to exist in two places at once today the biggest
1:59,brains on the planet are loggerheads over what this all means and where science goes next are there multiple
2:04,universes do we live in a matrix style simulation could there be an intelligent designer for this special uncensored
2:11,debate I'm joined by two scientists with very different answers to the very big question shan Carroll is professor of
2:17,physics and philosophy at Johns Hopkins University he hosts his own podcast Mindscape and draws audiences of
2:23,millions elsewhere dr eric Weinstein is a Harvard educated mathematician his appearances on the Joe Rogan Show alone
2:30,have been viewed 26 million times and he's a regular guest on Uncensored and
2:35,despite both being scientific podcasting rock stars Dr weinstein and Professor Carol have never actually appeared
2:42,together until now so welcome to you gentlemen and thank you for agreeing to
2:47,lock horns very I have to say very intelligent horns uh Dr carol let me ask you first of all this are we actually
2:54,here i think so i'm here i don't know about anybody else it could be a salt just
3:00,kind of thing but yeah you know I think that there's a lot of things that you can imagine meaning when you say things
3:08,exist things are real etc and I think that if you don't include you and me and tables and chairs etc I don't think that
3:15,you're on the right track in defining what it means to exist so yes we're here what is your main bone of contention
3:22,with Eric Weinstein uh you should probably ask Eric that i
3:28,mean I'm a working physicist i am a professor in a physics department i write physics papers uh I have found
3:35,myself in the awkward and unenviable position of defending the establishment
3:40,heterodoxy like it's never what I imagined I would be doing but there's good reasons why the heterodoxy is the
3:46,heterodoxy so I think that academic physics even though I'm happy to
3:52,disagree with certain choices they make about what to work on and what emphasis to put on there is working in good faith
3:58,i think that we're trying our best to understand the universe at a deep level string theory which we'll talk about in
4:05,the program is one example of this i have my uh my disagreements with string
4:11,theorists my agreements with them but I respect it and I think that they're trying their best and if someone else
4:16,comes up with a better idea they'll move what they're doing and focus on that idea it just hasn't happened yet for
4:22,those with with smaller uh brain power than you what is string theory
4:28,that's a great question and in fact very famous string theorist Joe Paulinsky wrote a very influential paper called
4:35,what is string theory decades after string theory started being a a popular theory to think about and the fact is we
4:42,still don't know yet it's an approach you start with a very simple idea that instead of the universe being made of
4:48,particle-like things at the fundamental level like the electron being a point-like particle the photon etc which
4:55,we all knew wasn't exactly right anyway but we can talk about that later replace that with a little loop of vibrating
5:01,string now why would you do that there's a prehistory that goes into features of the strong interactions that motivated
5:07,people to do it they looked at this idea what if the world were made of little loops of string rather than point
5:12,particles problematically the theory kept failing at what they were trying to do with it
5:19,which is explain the strong nuclear force because it kept predicting the existence of gravity so eventually
5:25,people said well wait a minute gravity exists maybe this is a theory of gravity as well and after uh many many years of
5:33,hard work on the part of people who were otherwise ignored by the community they showed that it's actually a very
5:39,successful theory of gravity and possibly everything else you have to buy
5:44,a lot of extra stuff like extra dimensions of spaceime that we don't see and so forth what is called the
5:50,holographic principle which again we could get into if you want to but the theory keeps moving forward while at the
5:56,same time utterly failing to connect directly with experiments so this has caused you know a lot of hair pulling
6:03,among the physics community the theory looks very promising but we haven't actually been able to put it to work to
6:09,connect to the real world okay Eric Weiser your response to that
6:14,well first of all uh I just assume that I'm being simulated by Sean Carroll uh
6:20,so who knows what's real you know more or less whether we're in a simulation or whether we're in not a simulation it's a
6:26,really good question i mean before you get into your into your response I mean we don't actually know do we i mean I I
6:33,have sometimes the most extraordinarily vivid deja vu dreams um or I dream stuff
6:38,and then it seems to happen whatever and it always makes me sit there shaking and trembling and sweating and thinking are
6:44,we all just living in some weird simulation how would we know
6:50,well maybe we should never have legalized cannabis then i don't know the uh the situation is that um I think that
6:57,Sean and I probably agree almost completely on everything until
7:03,1972 then you have the first uh really serious situation where a mysterious
7:10,term is not only introduced into our common vocabulary uh called quantum
7:15,gravity um but it takes over as a fictitious history that the uh central
7:22,problem of theoretical physics is the quantization of gravity um which is not
7:28,true historically and you can check it on Google and Grams this is just a fiction the progress in the object that
7:36,tracks our progress in um in physics called the lrangeian or the action uh
7:43,stops moving in 1973 and there's a bunch of wiggle words that
7:50,I don't think we have time for between fundamental physics and regular physics but then that my guess is is that the
7:56,first problem that Sean and I will find ourselves at loggerheads over is that I think that making quantum gravity the
8:03,holy grail of theoretical physics which is repeated and proceverated at nauseium is a is a terrible crime and what is
8:09,quantum gravity again for those who are not as offaya with this as you guys what is quantum gravity if you may the so
8:16,there's a standard story that you'll hear more or less Sean is a part of a group of about five people who do most
8:23,of the communication of theoretical physics to the American public in the UK there are different ones and there are
8:29,certain tropes that are repeated and you don't hear anything else so the trope that sounds something like this we have
8:34,two theories uh that are bedrock reality we one called the standard model which covers three out of four forces the
8:42,non-gravitational ones and all of the matter that we see in the universe as well as something called the Higsfield and maybe some other fields as well in
8:50,the other theory we have Einstein's theory of gravity which was put into relatively final form be before 1920
8:57,maybe by 1917 and then the claim is is that the incompatibility between the two
9:02,of them is that one of them is a quantum theory that is the standard model of uh the nuclear forces electromagnetism is a
9:09,quantum theory whereas Einstein's gra gravitational theory general relativity has resisted quantization and then as
9:16,the trope goes that that incompatibility must be resolved by forcing the children of Einstein to submit to the will of the
9:23,children of bore and that explanation to me is patently absurd the there's an
9:29,incompatibility in the classical version of the standard model before you get to the quantum version of the standard
9:34,model which is that one of them is a so-called gauge theory and the other theory cannot be gauged
9:41,um successfully at least and why does it matter so much then tax day has passed
9:46,but for millions of Americans that's where the trouble begins the IRS is now ramping up enforcement for those who
9:52,miss the April deadline or still owe back taxes well today's sponsor Tax
9:57,Network USA can still help if your books are a mess if you're self-employed or if
10:02,you're a business owner tax Network USA specializes in cleaning up financial
10:08,chaos and getting you back on track quickly they say the IRS is applying enforcement pressure at levels they've
10:14,never seen before but even after the deadline it's not too late to take control your consultation is completely
10:21,free acting now could stop penalties threatening letters and surprise levies
10:27,before they escalate call 1 8009581000 or visit
10:35,tnusa.com/pers that's tnusa.com/pers let
10:41,taxusa make the next move not the IRS
10:46,why does it matter well it it it it depends what you're trying to do i mean I can tell you why my the lead tweet in
10:53,my Twitter feed is assume a traversible cosmos if Einstein is left in force my
11:00,claim is is that there are only two rocks that Elon's uh chemical rockets can get us to um and that we've allowed
11:08,ourselves to fall into the misunderstanding of Einstein's theory as
11:13,the map of gravity rather than the territory of where we actually live i don't think we live in spaceime at all
11:20,and Pierce I just need to get to one further thing which is um that the
11:26,really significant problem I would say I am the only person in generation X to
11:31,have actually been present in the room when everything shifted uh toward string
11:37,theory which happened in 1983 at the University of Pennsylvania when a fellow named Edward Whitten gave the first
11:44,lecture uh that I think he ever did publicly on string theory and his will
11:49,and his mind were so powerful and his influence so so completely commanding
11:54,that the entire sociology of the field uh turned on a dime uh in ' 83 and ' 84
12:03,and as such I think I'm essentially the only person in generation X who saw the
12:09,old uh culture of physics become the new culture of physics and what I claim is
12:15,that Sean and I probably aren't that divided even on the mathematics of string theory what we where we are
12:21,bitterly divided is is that I believe that Shawn thinks that the system works pretty well i would say he's part of the
12:27,two cheers for uh the institutions uh meaning that he has a to be sure
12:33,paragraph saying that the institutions undoubtedly have their problems he wish things could be done better whereas I
12:38,see an absolute collapse in the ethics efficacy productivity of this at our
12:44,deepest levels and if you're thinking about dark energy dark matter dark chemistry all of the things that physics
12:50,has done essentially our modern world has been built by physicists even molecular biology and the internet uh
12:57,come out of physicists and CERN respectively uh with the worldwide web so if you think about the impact of
13:04,physics more or less the story of physics is the story of the world economy in the modern era and we will be
13:11,trapped here almost certainly unless you uh go in for science fiction tropes where we will not be able to get out of
13:16,the solar system and the moon and the Mars will be our only diversification giving the lie to Elon's claim that he's
13:23,going to save humanity by making us multilanetary the only real diversification exists is if we shed the
13:28,one atmosphere we share here uh and travel the cosmos okay so I my takeaway
13:34,from that and was brilliantly articulated um Sean is that basically
13:40,you are going to be responsible for the end of civilization as we know it
13:45,apparently yeah i didn't know but now you know the weight is is bearing down on my shoulders look the the story Eric
13:51,just told is a kind of wacky and wildly misleading history of physics in the
13:57,last 50 or 60 years uh the idea of quantum gravity is a very natural one
14:02,because the world runs by the rules of quantum mechanics as far as we know this is the international year of quantum
14:09,because it's the 100th anniversary of really figuring out how quantum mechanics works and the thing about
14:15,quantum mechanics is it's not a theory by itself it's a framework in which you can do theories in contrast with
14:22,classical mechanics from Isaac Newton that came before it and gravity our best current theory of gravity from Einstein
14:28,the theory of general relativity is a thoroughgoingly classical theory certainly the default expectation is
14:35,that someday we will better understand gravity at the quantum level you don't have to think that because you don't
14:40,have to think anything you're welcome to come up with better theories but again that's the default expectation if you
14:46,have a different point of view there's a certain burden of proof to convince people that it's interesting to
14:51,contemplate this other point of view the idea of actually doing the detailed calculations to quantize gravity goes
14:58,back to at least the 1950s but it instantly hit roadblocks and physicists were smart enough to know that it wasn't
15:04,working the way they wanted it to the very simple thing you do if I can get just a little bit detailed for a second
15:10,here because people never hear this and I think it's really really important to understand why string theory is so
15:16,popular if you want to invent a new quantum mechanical theory of the world the first thing you do is you ask
15:22,yourself if I have two particles and they come together and scatter there's a probability that different things will
15:28,happen i'm going to make photons i'm going to make electrons and posetrons or whatever and you calculate that
15:33,probability and the famous triumph of mid 20th century physics was to show
15:39,that you can do that and get a finite answer if you're sloppy about it your answer turns out to be infinity and your
15:44,and your theory is on the wrong track everything that we know about in the physical world has a nice finite answer
15:51,in this quantum mechanical realm except for gravity gravity doesn't fit and
15:56,indeed it was recognized pretty quickly that there was a good reason why gravity doesn't fit and it was almost impossible
16:02,to imagine fitting gravity in namely that gravity interacts with everything
16:08,gravity interacts with photons with electrons with quarks with whatever and so when you do this scattering
16:14,experiment you do the calculation everything in the universe contributes to the infinitely big answer that you
16:20,don't want to get apparently what you would need is some kind of miraculous
16:26,cancellation between all the different contributions from all the different fields and people looked at that and
16:31,"said ""We have no idea how to make that happen let's not worry about quantum gravity."" And then string theory comes"
16:37,along and again it wasn't even trying to be a theory of gravity but when they do this calculation the miraculous
16:44,cancellation happens in string theory you get a finite answer to what happens
16:49,when you scatter different particles off of each other that is right now the only theory in which that miraculous
16:57,uh happening actually works and this was finally put together as a sort of sensible viable theory in the mid 1980s
17:06,uh and it was a calculation by John Schwarz and Michael Green that showed that it the theory did not have what are
17:11,called anomalies and you can look up the magazines at the time physics Today ran an article saying anomaly cancellation
17:18,launches super string string bandwagon the point is the reason why I had to go
17:24,into those details is many many physicists instantly became interested in string theory and quantum gravity who
17:31,were not before but the reason they did is not because Ed Whitten is a smart guy
17:36,and he towers over the field it's because there was a calculation that showed the theory is promising
17:43,"physicists are not sheep if Ed Whitten had said ""We should all work on this,"" but everyone else looked at it and"
17:48,thought it wasn't very promising he would have been ignored but since then there's no competitor to string theory
17:55,that has had that miraculous feature that string theory has and just before I go to Eric to respond to that your
18:01,belief is as a result of all this it is more likely than not that there are
18:06,there's a multiverse there are many other worlds i'm not misrepresenting my own uh well you're in the you're you're
18:14,saying true things for the wrong reasons it's what philosophers call a getier problem um I'm a believer in uh the many
18:20,worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics that's a question about the foundations of quantum mechanics which again goes back to the 1950s but that is
18:28,more or less separate from the question of which model within the world of quantum mechanics is the right one is it
18:35,field theory is it string theory is it loop quantum gravity is is it something else so I I do believe that the best
18:42,understanding of quantum mechanics we have right now implies the existence of parallel universes again that could be
18:48,true and if we have a better theory that comes along I'm happy to change my mind there's also a separate idea of the
18:55,multiverse that comes with combining string theory with inflationary cosmology a scenario of what happened
19:02,very close to the big bang so those are two different ideas about the multiverse
19:08,many worlds of quantum mechanics says literally every time I make a quantum measurement now there's two worlds in
19:13,which different measurement outcomes were obtained the string theory multiverse says very very very far away
19:20,in cosmological distance there's a patch of space where conditions look remarkably different than they do here

20:20,stronger and show up ready for your family your work and your country too okay Eric your response yeah I just
20:29,got completely misprayed and this is uh actually I'm glad that this is happening because this is sort of what happens
20:35,when you tangle with the group of people who are supportive of this program i did not say uh what I think Sean is choosing
20:43,to either infer incorrectly or imply uh that somehow the world is not quantum
20:49,mechanical or quantum field theoretic and that somehow gravity is given a hall pass to go home and enjoy relaxation
20:56,where everyone else has to work hard what I said was that um the idea of
21:01,forcing gravity to submit to the same quantization procedures that have been successfully applied to other forces and
21:09,to matter uh has not worked it has stagnated the field and that quantum
21:16,harmonization is far more important you could also decide to geometize the quantum rather than quantize gravity and
21:24,thus quantize the geometry so because Sean's framework precludes somebody
21:29,saying something outside the framework the inference is is that someone ignorantly just said that gravity can be
21:36,kept out of uh the quantum framework which I absolutely don't say you'll also
21:41,notice that Shawn did not choose to take issue with the fact that one of these is a gauge theory and another one isn't a
21:48,gauge theory and so that there is a problem with gauging gravity and what that means and the fact that we're
21:54,getting no actual progress in the harmonization of gravity with the
22:01,quantum that can uh give us a green light and tell us where we're going like I would happily see to Shawn all sorts
22:07,of things like the string theorists are by far the smarter group of uh all
22:13,people trying to go beyond the standard model in general relativity i would further see that if the task is to
22:19,quantize gravity directly the string theorists and the string theory program have been more successful but what you
22:25,just saw is an example of what is actually going catastrophically wrong in the field that a dominant narrative that
22:32,has been proceverated into an as if reality has created two teams a smart
22:37,team that gets it and a dumb team that just doesn't and that kind of toxic
22:42,sociology is the true problem and my guess is that that will recur multiple times during this thing is that I will
22:50,not be heard and that Shawn will continue to have a version of Eric that lives in his head uh which shares my
22:57,name but not my understanding nor my beliefs and that is of course if we get past the hurdle of whether we're all
23:02,here at all um now Eric Eric you've come up with an alternative theory of everything it's based around geometric
23:10,unity and my understanding is it's it's a proposed framework aiming to unify the fundamental forces of nature including
23:17,gravity and quantum mechanics within a single geometric structure introducing a
23:23,14dimensional manifold that extends spaceime and embeds known particles and
23:28,forces into a larger mathematical context and the observation we had here
23:34,in the research is that while ambitious the theory remains largely unpublished and peer-reviewed literature has not yet
23:40,been formally tested or widely accepted by the physics community now because you're so uh smart about this stuff your
23:48,geometric unity paper is 69 pages long extremely complex way over my head so we
23:53,did what everyone in my position does these days we went on to YouTube and saw uh if we could find anybody who'd
24:00,analyzed it and had a conclusion and we found this thank you to Eric Weinstein it's an
24:06,avantgard and creative theory kurt here several months later this has been so
24:12,long in the making gez you have no idea anyhow I wanted to say that I mean what I just said i may have said this before
24:18,in the iceberg and if I haven't I should have because it bears repeating i haven't seen a theory like this come
24:24,from any single individual ever not one that's this fleshed out or has this
24:30,amount of unexampled connections within itself as well as to what's known as the
24:35,theoretical physics backbone that we talked about earlier now Eric um there's
24:40,lots of people doing stuff like that about it um why do you think that the
24:45,mainstream physics world is not taking this seriously enough
24:51,well first of all I disagree you see part of what's going on is that Shawn is part of a group of physics
24:58,influencers who are constantly spreading misinformation which leads to a climate of fear um you know I I for example
25:07,found the following quote of Sean what I really really want to get across to the audience is that nobody in physics
25:13,departments is discussing this with other people in physics departments now I don't happen to be coming to you from
25:19,a physics department at the moment but I happen to be on a 5day visit to a
25:26,leading physics department um and in this situation
25:32,uh I just had a 9-hour conversation and talk with 3 hours or four hours rather
25:37,of that being an explication of geometric unity what Shawn is doing
25:43,"constantly is attempting to say ""Look let's do some pattern matching we have a man uh generously in midlife he's not"
25:51,trained in the subject he doesn't appear to accept the quantum gravity program uh he appears to be possessed of the idea
25:58,that a single individual Ed Whitten caused all sorts of people who aren't cheap uh to cohhere into a single
26:05,framework that has been proverated and uh doesn't seem to produce fruit
26:11,um he has a telling of the tale that is first of all just not courageous it's
26:17,it's at odds with reality uh from my experiences in this physics department
26:23,um what I can tell you is that we have a situation in which everybody sees the
26:28,problems and so when Sean does a 4-hour um podcast which I think maybe three
26:34,hours I'd recommend to anybody because Sean is one of the best explainers and also extremely good at mathematics and
26:40,keeping true to actual physics in terms of his understanding um you know he then
26:46,goes into this thing that there is no crisis in theoretical physics and as one of my physics colleagues said last night
26:53,the first rule of physics fight club is don't talk about the problems with physics fight club
26:59,uh there is a self-evident crisis everybody I can show it to you numerically uh somehow the idea is that
27:07,a small number of people who are either at the top of the physics influencer pile which is where I would put Shawn or
27:15,at the top of the uh prestige pile in research have held a view that is
27:22,completely odds with reality which whose key feature is the exclusion of
27:27,different perspectives ive so when for example I I can tell uh I can I probably can guess the AI pierce from which you
27:34,got the analysis of geometric unity uh what you see is a very strange situation
27:41,where a group of people go around attempting to throw shade on anyone who questions whether there's a massive
27:47,problem in physics that everybody uh who's actually in the game uh can see
27:52,with their own eyes now if you ask me what's going on with geometric unity I can say something very simply that
27:59,because you have a very large viewership will go out to many people you won't understand it but I'll it'll be over
28:04,very quickly and it should be an astounding comment if you take a Lorenzian metric as a section of a a
28:10,bundle of pointwise Lorren metrics and pull back the vial positive vial
28:15,spinners uh with suitable um passing to maximal compact subgroup you get one
28:22,generation of petis salam grand unified firmians now that was very quick but
28:28,what it really just said is that general relativity knows the standard model anybody of Shaun's ability should be
28:35,able to parse that 202 sojourn and say is that something we know is that
28:40,something that might be interesting then we what we'll have is we'll have the typical physicist large language model
28:46,conversation in which physicists will ask do you have a new prediction at anything at electroeak scale which is a
28:52,question that doesn't get asked to the string theorists so you have a differential treatment in which the
28:58,physicists remember what physics used to be like in the mid- 20th century when they're hearing a competitor and they
29:05,choose to forget it when they're hearing something that comes from this other community hence I think what you're
29:11,going to find is if you look at this three-hour uh documentary that was just made on geometric unity which itself has
29:17,flaws by a person who does not have a PhD it evidences the highest level of
29:23,understanding of geometric unity found in a second person over 41 years of trying to have conversations with
29:29,physicists who tend to be polarized by one collection of theories led by a
29:35,single individual now everybody knows how much I enjoy my
29:41,tea and I'm very happy to say that today's show is sponsored by Peaks Pure Fermented Teas these are not your
29:47,average bruise they're sourced from 250-y old wild trees in the Himalayan foothills which are untouched by modern
29:54,farming no pesticides no fertilizers just nature at its best pure delivers a
30:00,full spectrum of prebiotics probiotics and postbiotics just like the fermented
30:05,foods found in longevity hotspots it comes in crystal form so there's no messing around just dissolve sip and
30:12,feel the difference it's trusted by health experts including Casey Means and Dr mark Mark Heyman there's teas for all
30:19,occasions and they all support your gut health metabolism and cellular renewal the next time you put the kettle on ask
30:25,yourself is my tea working as hard as me peaks pure fermented teas for the gut of
30:31,a Brit and the longevity of a Himalayan monk get 20% off for life plus a free
30:38,frother and glass beaker with the pure bundle visit
30:44,peaklife.com/pers that's peak
30:52,piqu.com/pers okay Sean Carol well I find it very telling i
30:57,don't know it makes me sad that you are looking for a second opinion about geometric unity and you go to YouTube
31:04,and see what pops up i I don't think that's the standard to which we would like to aspire there are professional
31:11,physicists right there in your country who work on understanding quantum gravity field theory geometry at a deep
31:18,level and you could ask them what they think look there's a lot of talk so far about sociology and I'd much rather talk
31:24,about physics but I would like to let people out there know who might be
31:30,working outside the academic physics community that it is 100% possible to
31:35,have a good idea and have it have an impact on what physicists do but it's
31:41,not easy you have to do a certain amount of work to show that your theory is worth the time that it is respectable
31:48,that it is interesting that it is promising the first thing you got to do is make sure that your theory makes
31:54,contact with modern physics as it is understood if you have a new paper out business are going to look at it they're
32:00,going to look for you know where's the lrangei and where's the interactions is the proton stable is there dark matter
32:06,like how does it fit into what I already know
32:11,eric's paper has none of that you would also ask have has the theory been shown
32:17,to be viable in a very basic way is it stable is it free of anomalies is it
32:23,finite in the sense of the quantum mechanical calculation that I already mentioned again none of that is there
32:29,are there any new predictions eric says in completely correctly string theory doesn't make any new predictions either
32:36,but also I I really don't want people to get the idea that string theory has some dominant picture in my department at
32:42,Johns Hopkins we have Let Let me just finish and then you can talk that I think it's a good system in my
32:48,department at John's Hopkins we have six professors in the theoretical physics group one of them does string theory and
32:54,even he only does it sort of halfime i wish we had more honestly this is very typical even at the most stringy
33:01,departments it's maybe half the people who do string theory there are plenty of other approaches being advocated and
33:07,many of them do make different predictions and we're looking for them in cosmology and astrophysics and
33:12,elsewhere and finally does your theory solve any interesting problems that we already thought we had that's the reason
33:19,why string theory became interesting because we had this this problem with quantum gravity that it gave infinite
33:26,answers and string theory solved that problem and again I see none of that in Eric's paper so it's very possible that
33:34,somewhere in Eric's theory there are interesting ideas but he has given us no reason to think that it is a promising
33:41,theory i encourage other people who would like to have an impact on the research agenda of modern physics to
33:48,take these easy steps rather than going on podcasts and talking about their victimization
33:53,okay Eric it's always uh it's always a pivotal moment in these debates when you put your glasses on so I'm bracing
34:01,myself this is first of all Sean has been nothing but civil throughout our relationship
34:08,he's also extremely nasty but I really appreciate the civility and I attempt to
34:13,respond in kind sean and I really shouldn't be divided but we appear to be i don't understand it um he did respond
34:20,it just shows that none of this is serious serious
34:25,um speaking about what I'm talking about he said uh this is not something that is
34:31,going to be a thing he also says that he hasn't read it so let me say a bunch of things to Dr carol dr carol I'd like to
34:38,hear your explanation for three generations of flavor chyro firmians with the observed quantum numbers under
34:44,the group SU3 cross SU2 + U1 in another podcast you said before I listen to your
34:51,theory you should listen to my Sean Carroll's theory my theory is known as the standard model i can give you an
34:57,explanation for why SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 why there are three generations why
35:02,16 particles in a generation why the observed quantum numbers are the way they are why the Hig sector comes out of
35:09,seemingly nowhere uh with a cortic potential with a a quadratic term why
35:15,the Yukawa coupling is uh just there just so in order to produce mass uh when
35:21,the weak force forbids a mass directly in the DACA operator uh Shawn knows what
35:26,every single thing that I just said is in that statement um why Shawn chooses
35:32,to mispray the fact that I can say why there should be dark matter what the dark energy is what the exact quantum
35:39,number assignments are for the two families that are luminous that have yet to be seen
35:44,um I have no idea because Shawn also proudly says is that he hasn't looked at it and hasn't read it that's why he says
35:50,that there are no Lrangeians in it uh I have no idea where Shawn gets this stuff
35:57,sean is insistent that the idea that somehow I am not choosing to go through
36:02,the usual channels uh and instead talking as he is right now via YouTube
36:08,is somehow significant when I've just given talks in three different countries on dark energy and by the way every time
36:16,I talk about talking about this somebody is telling me don't talk about the fact that you're actually in a physics
36:21,department and what I'm trying to tell you is I give talks in physics departments i hang out with physics
36:27,colleagues i'm welcomed at places like the Institute for Advanced Study MIT etc
36:33,etc and yet I have to deal with this nonsense i talk to both physics colleagues you know right now you've got
36:39,a giant problem called something called deesi or desi the dark energy or is it
36:45,spectroscopic instrument which is at the moment going after Einstein's unwanted cosmological constant that is not a
36:53,constant the dark energy is not a constant term that is the only term that you can put into the Einstein field
36:59,equations because the Einsteinian curvature satisfies an automatic differential equation called divergence
37:05,free so if you have another term in the uh equation it has to have the same
37:11,property there's only one known automatic equation which is that the metric of Einstein that creates spaceime
37:16,is annihilated by its own leviche connection and Sean you're misrepresenting things because I'm going
37:22,to give a formula for the dark energy i do all sorts of things that you have no idea of because your attitude which you
37:29,repeat in other podcasts and I highly advise you to spend more time in your physics department and less time on
37:34,YouTube um is is that this is not a serious thing nobody's taking it seriously and
37:40,your misportrayal of the situation uh is nearly constant for reasons that
37:46,completely elude me Sean the good news is I have read Eric's
37:51,paper here it is i actually have it here right here and uh it's worse than you
37:57,would think you know it just very quickly it starts off by saying the author is not a physicist and is no
38:03,longer an active academician but is an entertainer and host of a podcast this
38:08,work of entertainment is a draft work in progress and it may not be built upon so
38:14,we're not allowed to think about Eric's theory and write a follow-up paper about it no you're very contradiction to
38:21,everything that is normally done in scientific discourse you hope that
38:26,"people build upon your theories you don't try to prevent them and then later on it says ""This document is an attempt"
38:32,to begin recovering i'm going to read this this document is an attempt to begin recovering a rather
38:39,more complete theory which at this point is only partially remembered and stitched together from old computer
38:44,files notebooks recordings and the like dating back to as far as 1983 and this
38:50,is why this is paper is not going to appear in the peer-reviewed literature it's not serious it's a dog ate my
38:57,homework kind of thing if you have a dark matter thing if you have a dark matter prediction if you have a dark
39:03,energy prediction I want to see a plot in the paper i want to see red ship versus I want to see a calculation of a
39:11,relic abundance so I can figure out how much dark matter is supposed to be if you do that people will pay attention to
39:18,the theory it's very possible sean first of all um how dare you second
39:25,of all if you're going to go of the No Sean how dare you cast shade and
39:32,dispersions of the kind that I wouldn't seek to cast on you but I will now uh okay i'm not seeking your favor nor do I
39:39,nor do I need to seek your approval as you know you failed to gain tenure uh at
39:45,the University of Chicago you're not highly regarded in the field and again I'm only returning the shade in which
39:50,you just yourself cast i wouldn't have done this otherwise you then spent time as a non-tenured faculty at uh Caltech
39:57,and you only gain tenure in a non-standard professorship you're not a leading person in the field um my belief
40:05,"structure about this is is that you imagine that I'm coming to you saying ""Oh Sean Carroll let find a let me tell"
40:12,"me which graph I graph I should do so that I can please you."" As you know because you've read the paper you what"
40:19,you said about lrangeians is false what you said about predictions is false
40:25,my concern is what you did is that you seized upon something where people have built on my ideas since
40:31,1994 the equations that Natty Cyborg and Ed Whitten introduced that took over the
40:37,world were called the insufficiently nonlinear equations when I was at Harvard in 1987 and introduced them the
40:44,question is why appear as an entertainer rather than as a physicist first of all ne neither you nor I are trained as
40:50,physicists Sean you're actually trained as an astronomer um what you have in this situation is is that you and I are
40:57,both interloping in a field that is not the one to which we trained that doesn't bother me about what you're doing i've
41:03,enjoyed some of your papers i've thought very poorly of others uh you have a wide range of interest i think you're very
41:09,creative uh your intellectually insulting aspect reminds me of you as
41:14,the Marian Twinet of theoretical physics influencers uh I'm not here to please
41:20,you you know that there are tables in the document that you're reading that have plenty of predictions you know that
41:26,it solves plenty of problems what you are doing is creating an environment of
41:32,fear where every university worries what does it mean to talk to this
41:37,person and what I would say to you is you are commenting on the effect that
41:43,you are in fact inducing you and a small cadre of people are like intellectual
41:50,border collies of the physical sciences uh casting shade dispersions on those
41:56,who are succeeding where the quantum gravity string theoretic and m theoretic
42:01,programs are failing sean look I mean I didn't say anything about
42:07,Eric as a person his history or anything like that i said things about the paper
42:12,everything he says about me is like 90% true as as many things he says the paper
42:18,is not giving us any reason to think that this approach is promising there is no quantum mechanics in the paper
42:25,there's no attempt at showing that this solves any of the known problems of quantum gravity again it's not just
42:32,about Eric it's about anyone if you want to make an impact on the physics research community you have to give them
42:40,a reason to think that what you do is promising sean you have a serious
42:46,problem with dark energy that you're developing and it's going to go right through having being a problem with lambda CDM to eventually being a problem
42:53,with the Einstein field equations themselves perched as they are at top the space of metrics as an completely
42:59,inadequate uh space of field content what you've just said and what the
43:04,aspersion that you have just cash uh cast you are simply not qualified to say what you have said is that I have given
43:11,no reason let me imagine that that paper which was a draft rush to get to an April 1st date um remains in in a world
43:20,where Sam Alman and Elon Musk uh continue to compete for better and better AIs what would you say if at some
43:27,"point uh those AIs then got to that paper and said ""Holy cow that is exactly"
43:35,"uh what we've been missing this thing solves all sorts of problems."" And the problem that we have is that a group of"
43:41,influencers with a pension for being and this is one becoming one of my least favorite words although I didn't have
43:46,any negative association until recently debunkers the the problem Sean is is
43:52,that you and I are naturally alied on almost everything we're not very far
43:58,apart i don't disagree with the standard model i think the standard model is the most beautiful piece of uh differential
44:04,geometry before it becomes theoretical physics but what one of the things that you just said is that it's a classical
44:10,music a classical field theory that is not quantized as you well know there was
44:16,a revolution in the 1970s which said that we blew Hamiltonian analysis and that in fact
44:23,every phase space carrying a simplectic form can be treated um locally as if that simplectic form is
44:31,the curvature of a line bundle and the se L2 sections of that line bundle form a Hbert space and the P and Q coordinate
44:37,functions can be promoted to operators it said that wine is you what you get when you stop grape juice from becoming
44:44,vinegar and in fact Hamiltonian analysis is what happens when you take a physical problem and you stop it from quantizing
44:51,itself that was one of the great errors of our time that Hamiltonian analysis was actually pointing the way to saying
44:57,that most classical problems contain the seeds of their own quantization um you
45:03,know all this stuff and I know this stuff we know the same people uh we probably can work in the same notation
45:09,my guess is is that if you and I got over uh whatever this bizarre tension is between us and buried the hatchet um my
45:17,"guess is that after two days you'd say ""Boy I really just didn't understand what he was saying."" You know what i would love that to be the case and maybe"
45:24,you guys can can make that happen talking of dark energy a little bit of dark energy has crept into this debate
45:30,so I'm going to try and end on a slightly lighter note and these will require much shorter responses but I
45:37,just want to see whether you guys I mean as you said Eric you agree about a lot of stuff do you agree about mostly yeah
45:43,mostly i want to ask whether you agree about some of these fundamental things which have struck me as interesting about where we are professor Steven
45:50,Hawking I did the last television interview that he ever gave before he he died he said that the uh biggest threat
45:58,to mankind was if artificial intelligence learned to self-design do
46:04,you agree Sean no I don't think that's the biggest threat to mankind i think that AI is a
46:10,threat but in a completely different way than is usually portrayed uh the AIs that we're working on now are not really
46:17,the kind that will reach general intelligence in the way that we think about it there's no obstacle to reaching that in principle but the currently
46:24,popular uh architectures aren't on that trajectory the real problem as we saw
46:29,just this week with the Chicago Sun Times is people are lazy and people use
46:35,AI for the wrong reasons this was a very very trivial example where they published an article about the fun
46:42,summer book reads this year which was completely hallucinated by an AI and they just published it in the newspaper
46:48,that doesn't really hurt anybody but when these architectures are being put to work in things that could actually
46:55,hurt people that's when AI is going to have a really bad impact eric
47:00,I would say I completely agree with Sean i believe that the biggest problem and threat to humanity is that we share a
47:06,single atmosphere we can have different land masses but we have to share one atmosphere and that um pathogens
47:14,radiation and climate are all bound up in this one resource and I would say
47:19,that the biggest problem that I'm seeing is a general um madness in the American
47:25,political system on both left and right where we went from being the thing that was like the control rod stopping the
47:31,world from going critical uh to a crazy isolationist perspective where the
47:37,Democratic party is not able to restrain the worst excess excesses of the Republican party and conversely and I
47:43,fear that what we're going to see is a move towards nuclear proliferation which remains the single greatest threat which
47:49,is what we physicist physics people uh unleashed in November of 1952 at a
47:54,thermonuclear level and I think we've since we've never used such a thing in in anger and we've had a testband treaty
48:00,since the early 60s we are completely unprepared for what the cost is of retreating as the world's policeman
48:06,fascinating um Sean will we ever be able to time travel either forwards or back
48:14,well forwards I time travel all the time yesterday I time traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am i mean that's
48:20,not that hard einstein showed us that there's a trick you can even travel into the future faster by either moving near
48:27,near the speed of light or by hanging out in a strong gravitational field like a black hole backwards in time no I
48:33,don't think that we're going to be able to do it i've written papers about it uh it's it's something that is I would say
48:38,conceivable but not plausible we know how it might work in principle but all
48:44,the indications are it's not going to work in practice eric Well as as Sean has thoroughly digested
48:50,uh my paper he knows that I believe that there are either five or seven dimensions of time in a 14-dimensional
48:58,world which is split five of time uh 9 of space or seven of time seven of space
49:04,so when you talk about time travel it's times travel and only when time is
49:09,one-dimensional is there an arrow of time if there were two dimensions of time you'd have a whirlpool three dimensions would result in a right-hand
49:15,rule of time these things are technically called orientations one of the things that is really interesting
49:21,about multiple dimensions of time which leads to something which is very poorly studied called ultra-hyperbolic
49:26,equations is that you have the opportunity of going back in time without going back through time so just
49:32,as you can uh play a record and when the stylus comes to the uh inner circles of
49:38,the record you can jump again to any track that you like on a cassette tape you have to go back through time so my
49:45,belief is no we will not go back through time but we will have to figure out uh
49:50,to how to stop thinking in terms of initial conditions because it is only in the case of a single dimension of time
49:56,leading to hyperbolic equations that you have that luxury so I think that times
50:01,travel is going to be perhaps the most interesting thing to come out when you ask why should we worry about these
50:07,things buckle up fascinating uh and my final question is my probably the
50:12,biggest question I I can ask any guest and I've asked quite a few of them i have to say with very limited responses
50:18,so I'm asking two highly intelligent people this question now which is I
50:24,happen to believe in God and the reason I do other than the fact I was reared as a Catholic by my my mother um is because
50:31,I genuinely think there must be a superior being out there who is able to
50:39,answer this fundamental question in a way no human being has been able to
50:44,answer it for me which is for those who believe in the big bang theory what was
50:50,there before the big bang in other words what was nothing and what was there
50:56,before nothing and because I do not believe a human brain can answer that
51:01,question there must be de facto a more superior thing out there that can
51:09,sean well I'm glad to be the one who frees you from your religious convictions because the human brain can
51:16,absolutely tackle that question and it does so all the time i encourage uh viewers listeners to listen to the
51:23,upcoming episode of my podcast called Mindscape where I talk to Nas Fshorty
51:28,and Phil Halper about exactly this question what happened at or before the Big Bang yeah we don't know the answer
51:35,we don't even know whether the Big Bang was the beginning well they Well there you go so the fact that we don't know doesn't
51:42,mean we can't know those are two very different statements well if you don't know you you can't know at the moment
51:47,surely you have to admit you don't know i don't know and we're doing science on
51:53,it in the hopes that we will know but with respect Sean sean with respect it is utterly impossible you will never as
52:00,a human being be able to tell me what was there before nothing how can you you can't comprehend it can you i come up
52:08,with a theory i show that the theory fits the data that's how we do it what was there before nothing then go on best
52:13,guess we don't know my personal favorite theory is there was a pre-existing universe out of which our cosmos arose
52:20,as a baby universe quantum fluctuation what was there before that no it's infinite in it's infinite in time in
52:25,both directions so what was there before so you mean it's never ending yeah I
52:32,wrote a book if you want to read it pierce from eternity to here it's a great book i do but what's there before
52:37,eternity there was no such thing as before eternity like what is less than minus infinity that's not a sensible question
52:43,to ask yeah but I think it's a copout by you if you don't mind me saying this very respectfully to say that something
52:49,is infinite because if you're saying it's infinite you don't have to answer the question you've just made that up you don't know it was infinite th this
52:55,very often happens in the progress of human knowledge that a question that we thought was an interesting one becomes
53:02,not answered but shown to be uninteresting because we get a deeper understanding see that I'm sorry i'm
53:08,going to come to you Eric on this that seems to me a very pompous answer that is basically trying to apply a superior
53:14,intelligence to a response to a lesser mortal by saying that my my my attempt
53:20,to ask get this question answered is so stupid that there should be no need by
53:26,the brain power in front of me to answer it no it's exactly the opposite of that
53:31,i don't know why people are trying to psychoanalyze me and and think about what I'm thinking of them what I'm saying is the question of what happened
53:38,before the big bang is primmaashi a perfectly sensible question to ask but
53:44,we need to be open to the possibility that there is no beginning to the universe that the universe yeah but that
53:51,is a ridiculous thing to say because you know you know that your human brain
53:58,cannot comprehend something that has no beginning how can it we can't I can
54:04,comprehend the real numbers they go from minus infinity to infinity i don't see why it's harder to comprehend infinity
54:12,years versus 14 billion years that doesn't make sense to me all right Eric am I am I mad
54:20,no i mean look uh one of the things I like Pierce is that you invite me on this program often not to do battle as
54:26,we heard in the previous se segment so let me try something as an offering to the good Dr carol and he can tell me
54:32,whether this matches anything uh because I also share uh atheism at some level
54:37,along with him what I believe is that you're conflating three different category problems one you're talking
54:44,about something observational which might terminate at what we would call the surface of less scattering the thing
54:49,that we cannot see beyond with our instruments um that takes place uh along the lines
54:57,of something let's say call the cosmological model which is a reduction of Einstein's field equations assuming
55:04,greater certain uh symmetry that is a one comma three problem where you have one dimension of time three of space and
55:11,you can prove that there's a something called an essential singularity in the center of a black hole a Schwarzfield
55:17,singularity and an initial singularity and what would be called a Freriedman Robertson Walker metric
55:23,So that is a map of the territory that we are trying to observe but there's a third thing which is an assembly
55:30,sequence which also has an ordinal concept of development which could be
55:35,confused with a chronological one of time what is it that built the manifold so that time could progress now
55:43,the thing that's truly radical about geometric unity and I think Sean would probably agree with this if he's if he's
55:49,read it at all and I'm not sure that he has is that it is the only theory I know that begins from almost nothing and
55:55,tries to get and by a theory of everything we don't mean all knowledge we mean a complete uh set of the rules
56:03,of the universe what it says is is that four degrees of freedom are all that is necessary for the quark leptton CKM PMS
56:11,etc etc PNMS structure of the universe that basically sweet salty sour and
56:17,bitter or uh treble mid bass and reverb is all that's necessary to create a
56:23,universe what the point of a theory of everything which is almost never discussed and by the way I would point
56:28,out that I quite agree with Sean that philosophy when done well is uh an
56:34,essential complement to understanding physics lest we be tempted into the wrong kinds of thinking what I would say
56:40,a theory of everything is is a theory that starts from minimal assumptions recovers all of the rules and
56:48,demotivates the further scientific study of the initial set of data used to
56:54,construct the model not that the model not that the initial set of data is uninteresting but it that it'd be
56:59,interesting to theologians and philosophers rather than be motivating to mathematicians and physicists and
57:06,what I would say is if it's true imagine we were on the branch where geometric unity has proven itself and the good Dr
57:13,carol agrees what I would say is at that point why there are four degrees of
57:19,freedom is not a scientific question i don't think anybody that I know would be motivated to try to figure out how to
57:26,get four degrees of freedom from nothing uh that would be an interesting question and that is the question upon which your
57:32,god hinges but I would say that uh in the ca case of a scientific atheist what
57:39,we're trying to do is to come up with a complete set of the rules of chess as it were for the physical universe from
57:46,minimal inputs and those minimal inputs should have so little structure that they are demotivating to everybody who
57:52,studies partial differential equations or group representations but just to be clear Eric like Sean I think I've got a
57:59,point of of where you both come to the same place here you don't actually know
58:05,do you what was there before nothing no absolutely not i would love you know what I would love given I've only
58:11,understood about onetenth of what either of you have said for the last hour i would like to end on a point where none
